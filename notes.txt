# BROOKLYN
north = driver.find_element_by_xpath('//*[@id="city_1"]/div/div[1]/div/div/table/tbody/tr[1]')
# if borough has mutliple sets, second div has index. if it only has one set, no index

//*[@id="city_(index(region)+1)"]/div/div[index(region[index(set)])]/div/div/table/tbody/tr

every region in dictionary
every key-value pair in region dictionary has dictionary for sets 
every key-value pair in set diciontary has an array for the zip codes 

or i could just make separate variables... but then that wouldn't have index for region

1. switch to tab
2. check if set (table) has all the zip codes 
    a. for z in tab[region[set]]\
    

CHECK IF ZIPS ARE CORRECT: array1 = array2

loop through the rows in a table to create array from the zip codes
